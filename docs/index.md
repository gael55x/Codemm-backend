# Codemm Backend Documentation

This documentation is written for contributors and power users who need to understand (or modify) the backend’s behavior without reverse‑engineering prompts.

Codemm is an **agentic** system, but the backend is intentionally **deterministic at the boundaries**: the LLM proposes, deterministic code validates and decides what becomes durable state.
